# Curiosity
Being **curious** is an untrainable superpower. It is something that cannot be gained through training or education, but it's just part of who we are.  

Engineering cannot exist without curiosity. We know that needs motivate inventions and even trigger them. Engineering behind technical inventions is based on studies that are executed purely out of curiosity.

Successful developers, architects, and **digital executives** are always curious. Every time, there are things that they can focus on and investigate.

**Focus** is another important factor that everyone needs to have. Without focus, success is not possible unless you are exceptionally lucky.

In enterprises, focus is called **strategy**. While focus is an instantaneous aspect, strategy encompasses a more prolonged timeline. Let's leave the topic strategy for another article; it deserves a separate piece of its own.


I've decided to write about topics I've explored due to my curiosity or daily needs in a series. As we know, in today's world, we not only have a multitude of problems but also a plethora of alternative solutions. Especially when it comes to software technology, there are mind-boggling advancements every day. Some of these are widely accepted, while others, even if they're excellent, are relatively new or less recognized. I particularly want to write about a few subjects that are on my mind, especially in the realms of integration, backend development, big data, and data streaming.

As part of my role (Head of Integration and Platfrom ), I manage engineers who provide platform and integration support to software teams in functional products. While the platform team focuses on providing building blocks, the team also needs to operate like an enterprise architecture unit. Consolidation is a significant necessity in larger companies. in other words focus. Focus also deserves a seperate piece of its own. Maybe more important. we can focus this later.
