Mule comes with built-in log activity, but it has some limitations. The log4m connector, however, enhances the default features by incorporating additional capabilities.
 - Built-in JSON logger
 - Correlation ID (choose between default correlation ID or a custom one)
 - Transaction ID (business transaction ID)
 - Log type (SUCCESS or FAIL)
 - Execution point name
 - Attributes of the execution point in the flow
 - Payload:
 - - Payload
 - - Error payload (in case of flow errors)
 - - HTTP response payload (detailed information in case of HTTP errors, without requiring additional configuration)"
