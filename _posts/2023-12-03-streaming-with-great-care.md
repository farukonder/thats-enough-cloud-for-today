Heraclitus believed that you can never step into the same river twice because everything is constantly changing. He thought this concept was crucial to how the universe operates. In simpler terms, his analogy suggests that even though a river may look the same, the water and life within it are always in change.

This analogy can also be applied to streams in software development, particularly integration. Although you have the same streaming object in hand, the data within is constantly changing. Just as we must handle the analogy's life with care, we also need to treat the data in streams with great caution.
